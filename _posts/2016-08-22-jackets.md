One day, my coworker, Jim, stopped by my cube. "You're a fashionista with your jacket collection!" Fashionista? Ask my sister...

However, Jim was not the first person to comment on my jacket collection. I'll admit, I am somewhat particular about my outerwear. Wind, temperature, precipitation, outfit-- these are all variables that factor into my jacket choice for the day. As Jim  put it, "I know being a woman is tough. Now I see that being a woman engineer is more tough!" One day in March (note the 19mph wind speed that day), Jim left a note next to my jacket. A sample blog post.

What incurred mild teasing has now become a daily reality. Earlier this month, I moved to the Bay Area, where the temperature swings between 50 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit each day. Here, summer is equivalent to that one week of "spring" Dallas gets in March.

While my jacket collection inspired this blog, this blog is not actually about jackets. (Sorry, Jim). 

As I prepared to move west, several people told me to keep them updated on how this transition was going for me. On one of my last days Plano, I told one of my previous managers that I needed to start a blog in order to stay in touch. "Call it West Coast Stuti," he quipped. I'm so glad we talked; otherwise, this blog would still be untitled and thus unpublished.

And now for my update:  
Moving to a new state is tough! I hadn't changed my permanent address since 2000, which actually, I didn't even change back then- my parents did. The move to California didn't sink in at first, but then I got a new license, a new license plate, etc. Now I feel like Texas is so far away...

Aside from moving pains, I'm enjoying this west coast life. The weather out here is beautiful, and I am thankful I chose an apartment that is walking distance to multiple grocery stores, retail, and restaurants. I have only fallen victim to the plastic bag ban once! Close proximity to a variety of places helped me get through the initial three days of no internet. I took the Caltrain to Santa Clara for work and walked to handful of coffee shops around my aparment to access WiFi. Even though I have my car now, I still prefer walking if I'm going somewhere that's less than fifteen minutes away.

I was nervous about attending grad school prior to orientation. However, after meeting the staff and hearing a few professors talk about their research interests, I am more energized and ready learn. There will probably be an update here once I see the syllabuses... or is it syllabi... Google says both.

Other observations:  
1. So many mountains. At some point, I'll take it for granted, but right now I can't imagine not noticing mountains in the distance. So beautiful!  
2. Also, so many Teslas. Everywhere.  
3. Being an engineer here is not cool- it feels like a baseline.  

Once I start classes and travel farther than five miles from my apartment, I plan to share more.

Until then,  
Stuti
