One day, my coworker, Jim, stopped by my cube. "You're a fashionista with your jacket collection!" Fashionista? Ask my sister...

However, Jim was not the first person to comment on my jacket collection. I'll admit, I am somewhat particular about my outerwear. Wind, temperature, precipitation, outfit-- these are all variables that factor into my jacket choice for the day. As Jim  put it, "I know being a woman is tough. Now I see that being a woman engineer is more tough!" One day in March (note the 19mph wind speed that day), Jim left a note next to my jacket. On it was a sample blog post.

What incurred mild teasing has now become a daily reality. Earlier this month, I moved to the Bay Area, where the weather swings between 50 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit each day. In the bay, temperature throughout the summer is equivalent to that one week of "spring" Texas gets in March.

While my jacket collection inspired this blog, this blog is not actually about jackets. (Sorry, Jim). 

As I prepared to move out west, several people told me that they would like to see how this transition was going for me. On one of my last days Plano, I told one of my previous managers that I needed to start a blog to keep everyone updated. "Call it West Coast Stuti," he quipped. Well, that solved one problem.

And now for my update:  
Moving to a new state is tough! I hadn't changed my permanent address since 2000, which truthfully, I didn't even change back then; my parents did. 

Aside from moving pains, I'm enjoying this west coast life. The weather out here is beautiful, and I am thankful I chose an apartment that's walking distance to multiple grocery stores, retail, and restaurants. I haven't fallen victim to the plastic bag ban yet! Although that's probably a matter of time... Additionally, close proximity to a variety of places helped me get through the initial three days of no internet. I took the Caltrain to the Santa Clara site for work, and walked to handful of coffee shops around my aparment to use their WiFi. 

Other random observations:  
1. So many Teslas. Everywhere.  
2. Being an engineer here is not cool- it feels like a baseline.  
3. Someone in my apartment building raced up the Empire State Building stairs at the age of 84 (two years ago). One of his sons is an Ivy League professor, and his other son is considered one of the top programmers in the Bay Area. You read that correctly.  

Once I travel further than five miles from my apartment and start grad school (two separate things- grad school is within the five mile radius), I plan to share more with you all.

Until then,  
Stuti
