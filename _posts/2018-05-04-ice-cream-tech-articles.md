Hi all! It's already MAY! To celebrate the warm weather, I compiled a list of Zagat-recommended Ice-Cream shops in three Texas cities (Austin, Dallas, Houston). I've indicated which ones are vegan friendly, or definitely have egg-free options. How many have you been to?

In other news, this semester, I took a course called Exponential Innovation. In class, we discussed how technologies converge and "go exponential". We've had a few writing prompts and were encouraged to share our writing on LinkedIn. Check mine out below if the topics interest you!

* [2018: Return of the Space Race](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/2018-return-spacerace-stuti-ghiya/) *(3 minutes)*

* [Doctors need to diagnose how artificial intelligence is taking over their ailing industry.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/doctors-need-diagnose-how-artificial-intelligence-taking-stuti-ghiya/) *(4 minutes)*

* [Singing praises of the music-streaming industry.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/singing-praises-music-streaming-industry-stuti-ghiya/) *(3 minutes)*

* [Cybersecurity: No more Band-Aids for an industry requiring redesign](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cybersecurity-more-band-aids-industry-requiring-redesign-stuti-ghiya/) *(3 minutes)*

That's all this time. Texas friends: Let me know if you manage to make it to all of these ice cream spots! :)
