<h4>Update</h4>

Jambo! 

This post is mostly about my Tanzania trip, but really quickly- I graduate in May! After 3 years of part-time studying, I'm almost there! Assuming I pass my last class...

But, on to a **very** late trip update.

<h3>Tanzania</h3>

<h4>Logistics</h4>
In late July to early August of 2018, I and 13 others in my extended family took a trip to Tanzania! It was my first time crossing the equator. We went on a three and a half day safari trip in Serengeti National Park, plus one day in Ngorongoro Crater. Including travel from Arusha to the parks and back, the trip was 6 days and 5 nights. Afterwards, we met up with family of family in Moshi and explored Mt. Kilimanjaro and the surrounding area.

The travel agency we used, recommended by the family local to the area, was [Leopard Tours](https://www.leopard-tours.com/). They handled the itinerary, including pickup from the airport in Arusha, meals, and transportation. You can discuss lodging with them, and they book it all for you as well. Between Leopard Tours and all the lodging, all meals are handled-- including lunches for the game drives. Leopard Tours even buys a supply of water bottles for the entirety of the trip. We stayed at resorts for the first and last nights, but stayed at tents for the other four nights. Bougie tents. With bucket showers and flushing toilets. More on this later.

We flew Emirates from Houston to Dubai, and then FlyDubai to Kilimanjaro Airport (JRO) in Arusha. 

<h4>Safari</h4>

After a delicious (included!) lunch at Ambrosia in Arusha, we went started driving towards the park. As we entered the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, we started seeing several Maasai people, and a variety of animals in the distance including monkeys, zebras, gazelles, lions. **Pro-tip:** Try not to waste time stopping for these animals unless they are within 1000 ft of the vehicle. It is very exciting, but it doesn't hold a candle to what you will see inside Serengeti National Park. We stayed at [The Retreat at Ngorongoro](https://www.theretreatatngorongoro.com/) on the first night. A beautiful resort, but we still had no idea of what we were about to experience.

The next day, we reached the park. Literally 30 seconds after entering, a giraffe crossed 20 feet in front of the jeep. That's when I realized what we were really getting into. Also, seeing a giraffe run is maybe the cutest and funniest thing I saw all trip.

Every day, went went on game drives. Our guide drove us around the park and we would all look for for animals. The park is huge-- we probably only covered about half the park during our trip. **Pro-tip**: Pack snacks for these game drives. We saw meerkat, lions, elephants, gazelles, warthogs, ostriches, and more. All in one afternoon. But over the next few days, we saw several species of antelopes and birds. We also saw hyenas, leopards, cheetahs, hippos, and African buffalos.

During late summer, the [migration](https://www.tanzaniaodyssey.com/tanzania/great-migration) starts. The wildebeest in Seregenti cross the Mara River into Maasai Mara in Kenya. If you go at exactly the right time, which is around late August, you can actually see them cross the river! We did not get to see the crossing, but we saw thousands of wildebeest. _Thousands_. You can see a glimpse below.

A few of us in the group got to see a black rhino. From very, very, very, very, very far. Even with binoculars, you could barely tell. Thank goodness for their distinguishing horns. They are very rare in the parks. **Pro-tip:** Take Binoculars!

For the four nights we spent in the park, we stayed at the [Kati Kati and Bologonya [camps](http://twctanzania.com/en/). They have tents with beds, sinks, normal US-style toilets, and bucket showers. (There's a man that fills up the bucket with hot water, and you use a chain mechanism to release water from the bucket. The chain controls water flow as well.) There is one main tent where breakfast and dinner are served. At Kati Kati, all the charging stations were in this main tent. In Bologonya, they had outlets in the tent. At night, the staff will walk to you and from the tent in case of any danger. 

At night, the tents are ... terrifying? Thrilling? One night, some of us heard a lion and hyenas fighting. Another night, my sister and I heard a lion softly grunting. And water buffalo loudly chomping on grass. We were whispering to each other to try and calm down. I was unable to distinguish whether an animal was rubbing against the tent, or whether wind was moving the canvas. We managed to fall asleep again after an hour of sheer terror. I definitely recommend at least one night in the tents, just for this type of experience.

On the last day, we left the park and drove to Ngorongoro Crater. Which is actually a caldera. It felt like the entire Serengeti compressed into a small area. If you don't have time to visit the Serengeti, a visit to the Ngorongoro Crater will give you a similar experience.

On our last night, we stayed at the [Ngorongoro Sopa Lodge](https://www.sopalodges.com/ngorongoro-sopa-lodge/the-lodge). We were exhausted, and a longer shower felt so good. The lodge was beautiful, and I wish we had more time to explore it! But alas, we had to return to Arusha, and then catch a bus to Moshi. 

Overall, the whole experiences was awing and humbling. I felt like I saw how the world looked a thousand years ago. 

<h4>Moshi</h4>
We spent a few days in Moshi, which is about an hour away from Arusha. On the first day, we hiked through a coffee farm to Materuni Falls. On the second day, we went to Mt Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. I've heard that for people who want to climb the tallest peak in each continent, this peak is the easiest one. And based on the beautful day we spent there, I'm not surprised. We were at about 11,000 ft, where we picnicked and went on a short hike. And on the last day, we shopped for souvenirs. I ended up getting some elephant pants, a Maasai shawl, African coffee, and pili pili hot sauce. 

Lastly, I watched Disney's The Lion King on the flight back. The movie matches up to what we experienced in the parks, in terms of landscape and wildlife. Confirmed.

<h4>Questions</h4>
If you have questions, let me know, and I'll answer as best as I can. Or if it's a common question, I'll add it below!

1. Vegetarian Food? Not an issue. Our group did not eat meat or eggs, and we found enough options. We would also tell the camp staff our restrictions, and they would try to adjust accordingly. The soups we ate while in the Serengeti were some of the best I've ever eaten! I'm not as sure about the availability of strict Jain or vegan options.

2. How long of a trip? In the Serengeti, spend at least two full days. After that, it depends on how much you love watching animals (add at least a half day) and if you want to see the migration (add a full day). For Ngorongoro Crater, one day is probably enough.

3. Weather? It's winter in the Southern Hemisphere! But it was still mostly between 60-80F the whole trip. The weirdest part was that the more north you go, the _warmer_ it gets. In winter, the wildebeest migrate _north..._
