When I first moved out to the Bay Area, I looked for lists of things to do. There seem to be hundreds of websites on this topic. I'm not sure how I found it, but one website, Far & Wise created an excellent [Bay Area Bucket List](https://farandwise.com/my-san-francisco/). What makes this list so unique is that I can import it into my [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) notebooks. Imported notes can be further customized. For example, I removed or modified the items that I would never do, usually related to trying food items.

I've found myself searching for more travel lists to import into Evernote, but I haven't found quite what I'm looking for. If you have suggestions, please share! Meanwhile, I thought I'd create my own lists. With this, I present to you, my United States National Parks Checklist. It includes all 59 National Parks, sorted by state.

Now, both of my travel checklists have Yosemite National Park on them. I'm happy to say that I'm going next month! Fun fact: the newest National Park is Pinnacles National Park, established in 2013. Maybe you can see a picture of Pinnacles in my previous blog post... ;)

It turns out that I have been to 6 National Parks (only counting what I remember). How many have you been to?
