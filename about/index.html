	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>Before I moved to the Bay Area, I had lived in Texas for sixteen years. After working for four years, I decided to go back to school for a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering... while continuing to work full-time. I hope to capture my experiences and share what I learn in school in this blog. Email me with any questions and suggestions! </p>
